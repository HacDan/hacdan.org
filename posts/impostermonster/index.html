<p>In this case, I&rsquo;d say the Imposter Monster is that voice in your head that continues to tell you you&rsquo;re not good enough. Reminds you you&rsquo;re not doing the right job. Drags your confidence through the mud and doesn&rsquo;t let you wash it off. This monster has to be biggest jerk on the planet earth. He&rsquo;s born from a lack of confidence, and feeds on self doubt. Which I&rsquo;d dare say is a viscious cycle.</p>

<p>Example time. I&rsquo;ve been working in IT for almost 10 years now. I&rsquo;ve been a computer nerd for even longer. I went to school for Computer Science for goodness sake. I know IT quite well. I&rsquo;ve been at my current gig for almost 3 years. To this day. I still don&rsquo;t feel like I should have this job. I know how to do it. I know what I&rsquo;m doing. I rarely come across problems I can&rsquo;t solve within a day, or at least that I can work out a solution to. (Implementation hell, amirite?) Yet, to this day, while writing this blog post, I can tell you I doubted myself yesterday on an implementation to resolve a problem. I was nervous to implement, even though I knew exactly how it would go down? Now&hellip; why is that? We&rsquo;ll get to that, but I&rsquo;ll give you a clue. <em>I&rsquo;m not a confident person.</em></p>
<h3 id="compsci-it-what-gives">CompSci? IT? What gives?</h3>
<p>Now, I mentioned I went to school for Computer Science. I specialized in software engineering. I&rsquo;ve been writing code since I was 16. My friend Derrick <a href="http://thrawn01.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">thrawn01.org</a>

 convinced me to switch majors into software engineering. He was honestly one of the main reasons I swapped, and I&rsquo;m very thankful for that and for him. He has had a very positive influence on my life, so, thanks, Derrick! With all that said, I hesititate every time I&rsquo;ve tried to switch careers into software engineering. I always feel like I&rsquo;m not good enough. I don&rsquo;t know enough. I&rsquo;m not advanced enough into this craft to be able to take a job doing it. Yet, over the past ~8 years I&rsquo;ve completed multiple major projects, along with creating two completely new apps from scratch, for my employers. All while working in IT! Now mind you, this weren&rsquo;t large scale projects. I was the only dev, but still. I&rsquo;ve done the work, along with contributed to quite a few open-souce projects.</p>
<p>Yet here I stand not having worked professionally in the career I want to work in. All because of the Imposter Monster!</p>
<h3 id="okay-thats-just-career-stuff-get-over-it">Okay, that&rsquo;s just career stuff. Get over it.</h3>
<p><img src="/tough.jpeg" alt="Hey Kid&amp;hellip; Toughen Up!"></p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right. It&rsquo;s just my career. Who cares? Just keep working right? Well. Let me tell you about one more job that I do.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a father. My wife and I have fostered ~10 kids or so. We currently have one adoptered daughter from the foster care system, and two biological children. I&rsquo;m dad to all three and before anyone asks, no, I don&rsquo;t consider my foster daugher any different than my biological children, I only mention it to show that we didn&rsquo;t just foster children, we even kept one! No take backs! Although, she&rsquo;s a preteen and right about now, I&rsquo;m thinking maybe a takeback might be in order&hellip; just kidding?</p>
<p><img src="/jk.jpg" alt="jk"></p>
<p>Anyway, let&rsquo;s stop beating around the bush. I feel like a failure as a father almost every day, if not every day. Sure, I have success throughout the day, but like most of you, I&rsquo;m not perfect. Maybe some day, but for now, I&rsquo;m not. Now, does this make me a failure as a father? Maybe, but logic states that I&rsquo;m probably not a failure, but here I am, thinking of all the things I could have done differently. How I shouldn&rsquo;t be a father. How these kids deserve better. How I should be trying harder every day to be perfect. The list goes on. So ya, that monster? He&rsquo;s in my head constantly. Now&hellip; let&rsquo;s get to that all import why.</p>
<h3 id="but-why">But Why?</h3>
<p><img src="/why.jpg" alt="why">
I really wanted to use the Ryan Reynolds one here, but my man Chan just seemed to be a better fit.</p>
<p>My understanding is it all boils down to confidence. Mainly self-confidence. I&rsquo;d say the largest misuderstanding I&rsquo;ve always had about self-confidence is that it was a direct reflection of your current <em>skill level</em>. Which obviously doesn&rsquo;t make any sense whatsoever. Self confidence is just ones trust in one&rsquo;s abilities, qualities, judgment, etc.. So, no skill required, right? I&rsquo;m not so sure, but at the same time this is like asking the overweight guy at McDonald&rsquo;s for nutrition advice. Probably not the best person to ask.</p>
<p>I can say, at least from my personal experience working on open-source software projects, that there are plenty of people that are seriously lacking in skill, but have plenty of self-confidence. I don&rsquo;t say this as a slight, but more of as a compliment. They&rsquo;re able to put themselves out there during a very early stage of their career development, or at least an early stage of their learning, and that&rsquo;s awesome. Sure, we can make fun of their code, write patch after patch to show them how to do it in a clear, concise, and efficient manner, but man, they still put it out there for the rest of us to critique. Long before anyone with a monster inside their head would have, and I think that&rsquo;s amazing. Hive mind, great minds think alike, yada yada yada.</p>
<p>Now, too much of a good thing isn&rsquo;t a good thing, or something like that. I&rsquo;m sure we all know someone with too much self-confidence. They&rsquo;re full of themselves. They don&rsquo;t know when to admit they&rsquo;re wrong. They truck right on through a problem <em>knowing</em> they&rsquo;re right, even though they aren&rsquo;t. I feel this level of self-confidence is no better than having zero or close to it. With zero self-confidence you&rsquo;re a push over. You live in a world of doubt. Things just aren&rsquo;t good. With too much self-confidence, well, let&rsquo;s just face it. No one likes you. Not even you; at least deep down inside anyway.</p>
<h3 id="how-do-we-fix-it">How do we fix it?</h3>
<p><img src="/fixit.jpg" alt="fixit"></p>
<p>Again, as mentioned, I&rsquo;m probably not the one to ask, but I know what has helped in the past so I&rsquo;ll reflect on that here. Take it for what it&rsquo;s worth.</p>
<ul>
<li>Journal
<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;ve found this to help in the past. Reflecting on what I have accomplished during the day. What I did right and what I did wrong. Frame the wrongs more as ways of improvement though. I&rsquo;m sure this will help keep you grounded, so you don&rsquo;t raise that self-confidence level too high.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Recite a mantra
<ul>
<li>I know. This one sounds crazy, but it works. I used this to get through a very dark time in my life. I told myself I was worth it. I told myself I was useful. I told myself I wasn&rsquo;t the scum of the earth. Try it. You&rsquo;ll look like an idiot, and that&rsquo;s okay. It&rsquo;s just for you anyway. You&rsquo;re not out reciting your mantra to the world. It&rsquo;s <em>your</em> mantra. Not anyone elses.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Socialize
<ul>
<li>I found this one to be another big help. I didn&rsquo;t end up socializing in person, but I would hop on <a href="https://www.ventrilo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vent</a>

 with some friends and we&rsquo;d just chat. Sometimes we&rsquo;d play video games while chatting, but honestly the most helpful time was just hopping on a &ldquo;call&rdquo; and talking about our day. I believe this one helped me the most as I&rsquo;m quite the introvert. If you&rsquo;re energized by hanging out with people in person, do so! I know, pandemic, COVID, MonkeyPox, etc. Whatever may still be going on, be safe about it, but get out and talk with other people.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Therapy
<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;m going to re-emphasize here that this is advice coming from someone that has very little to no self-confidence in really any area of his life, but if you&rsquo;re at that point in your life, maybe it&rsquo;s time to talk to a therapist. There are plenty of options now. I know there are websites that specialize in offering therapy remotely over the interwebz. Get in on that! I should probably be taking my own advice here, as I used to talk to a therapist right after my parents were divorced. We didn&rsquo;t really connect, but at minimum it was a place to vent. It helped. Probably more than I know.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-end">The end?</h3>
<p>I know I haven&rsquo;t blogged in a while, it&rsquo;s been a almost if not over two years now. I have a lot of drafts built up that I need to finish editing and publish, but alas, Mr. Imposter Monster is stopping me. I&rsquo;m working on it, but more content will follow. At some point. Hopefully more regularly. Maybe, just maybe, it&rsquo;ll help me to build more self cofidence? Until next time, or some cheesy nonsense.</p>
