        <p>Hear me out. I know, cheesy title to say the least, but it&rsquo;s what came to mind when I decided I wanted to write about this quandry of mine.</p>
<h2 id="frontend-backend-or-side-to-side">Front(end) Back(end), or Side to Side?</h2>
<p>That quandry is this (if you haven&rsquo;t figured it out from the title by now):  What stack to work with? Honestly? I don&rsquo;t know. I really enjoy backend development where I&rsquo;m working on API&rsquo;s, database integrations, and the like. I really do. I find it to be an interesting set of problems to solve, but I often wonder if I pidgeonholed myself into thinking that I had to be a backend developer because I&rsquo;m not an artist or designer. Of course all the devs I know are back end developers, but does that mean I have to be one? Of course it doesn&rsquo;t, but I&rsquo;m sure it does mean something. I mean, I really like solving logic puzzles as opposed to converting designs into usable code, but at the same time, I sure do like seeing a project through from start to finish.</p>
<h2 id="whats-a-boy-to-do">What&rsquo;s a boy to do?</h2>
<p>I wonder if there&rsquo;s a middle ground? Maybe working as a full stack developer? I dunno. I don&rsquo;t really like writing HTML/CSS and I have a preconceived notion that Javascript was written by the devil himself. I mean seriously, have you watched <a href="https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wat?</a>

 If you haven&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;ll wait. Well worth the 4m 17s of your life. Promise. Yes, even if you don&rsquo;t write code, it&rsquo;s quite hilarious. <a href="https://twitter.com/garybernhardt?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gary Bernhardt</a>

 has just a great presentation sense about him.</p>
<p>Back to the point. Full stack is mainly considered someone who works on the front and back end of a web app. From what I&rsquo;ve seen, this has become mainly a Javascript world. One language to rule them all, right? What could go wrong? I&rsquo;m sure a 1000 different things, but that&rsquo;s not the point here. I have a horrible preconceived notion of hating on Javascript and would rather not write any more of it than I have to. So, what&rsquo;s a boy to do&hellip;?</p>
<h2 id="side-to-side-mobile-development">Side-to-Side Mobile Development</h2>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;ve decided, but I&rsquo;m toying around the idea of getting back into mobile dev. Specifically on Android. &ldquo;Back into you say? You&rsquo;ve done mobile development before? Why Android?&rdquo;
Yes, I&rsquo;ve done some mobile dev work in the past. I created an Android app for the Blackberry Playbook back when Blackberry was trying to rework it&rsquo;s mobile offering. They had a runtime added to it&rsquo;s BB OS that could run Android apps. While this was an interesting forray into the 21st century, it didn&rsquo;t play out well for RIM.</p>
<p><img src="/blackberry_playbook.jpg" alt="Blackberry Playbook tablet"></p>
<p>Anyway, I wrote an app to get a free tablet because free tablet, duh? I learned a lot doing so, even though it ended up being pretty simple. Basically I digested an RSS feed for a WebComic I was binging at the time and then pulled the image from the webcomic, placed it into an ImageView. It also pulled the subtitle, similar to <a href="https://xkcd.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">XKCD</a>

 and placed it on the bottom of the image. You could flip through all available strips that were published. It wasn&rsquo;t perfect, but it was a lot of fun and was my first experience going from scratch to published with a piece of software.</p>
<p>With all that said, that leaves one question unanswered: Why Android? Sure, I could easily say I have some experience in it, therefore it&rsquo;s the logical choice. Or I could say that I&rsquo;ve been an Android enthusiast for quite some time. I even developed off an Android tablet for a few years for goodness sake. But in reaility, it&rsquo;s because I just like their development workflow better. I&rsquo;ve played around with Apple&rsquo;s setup. Swift is a great language, much better than working in Java, but Kotlin seems to be pretty good, too. While I don&rsquo;t have more than a couple of hours of experience writing it, I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s a suitable replacement for Java. Here&rsquo;s hoping I can avoid getters and setters. We&rsquo;ll see. I&rsquo;m not that far into my journey.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to follow along I&rsquo;ll be posting my code on <a href="https://github.com/hacdan" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a>

 and will be blogging about it here.</p>
<p>Until next time!</p>
