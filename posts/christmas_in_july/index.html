That’s the day my coupon code for a Google Pixel C expired. Counting down the days to when the dream of moving to said tablet would be shattered. Shattered on principal anyway. There was no way I could justify paying full price for the Pixel C. It’s great hardware, sure, but it’s not $500 worth of hardware.</p><p>Driving home from work on Tuesday my phone went off. A text message, probably another scammer. I checked the area code and noticed it was local. It was someone inquiring about my computer post on Craigslist. I was shocked to say the least. There hadn’t been any bites on my machine for a few months now and I had honestly given up hope. I answered the few questions that the buyer had and we worked out a price. Sure, it was less than what I was hoping for, but it would be enough. Enough to fulfill the dream of decoupling from distraction.</p><p>The buyer really wanted to meet that night, but I wasn’t home! We finally agreed to meet the next night at my house so he could check out the machine. The next night came and I honestly paced for a good hour in the office, wondering if this guy was going to come to pick it up. Time was running out and if this buyer didn’t work out, well I was going to pull the machine and work on my self-control.</p><p>So anyway, the buyer texted me letting me know he would be in there in about 30 minutes. Does this mean things were finally going to work out? I had a glimmer of hope that things would work out..</p><h2 id=it-happened-it-finally-happened>It happened, it finally happened!</h2><p>So, he showed, we talked, I made a new friend, and we even have a mutual friend! Things could not have worked out better, well I guess sooner would have been nice, but, patience really is a virtue! We were both satisfied with the deal and things worked out. I’m light one Haswell powered beast of a machine and that is a feeling I’m perfectly fine with.</p><h2 id=where-to-from-here>Where to from here?</h2><p>So where do we go from here? Well, as mentioned in a previous post, I had planned on moving to a tablet and keyboard setup, and that is exactly what I did. The night the machine sold I promptly hopped on the Google Store page and ordered up a Pixel C and Keyboard. Those should be arriving today(19th). I can’t wait to get home and unbox them and start using them. Over the next couple of posts I’ll have a hardware and software review of the device, so look for that starting this Friday!</p><p>Stay tuned!</p><h3 id=read-more-in-this-series>Read more in this series</h3><ul><li><a href=http://hacdan.org/post/christmas_in_july/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Overview</a></li><li><a href=http://hacdan.org/post/pixels_everywhere_%28review%29/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Hardware Review</a></li><li><a href=http://hacdan.org/post/sweet_sweet_nougats/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Software Review</a></li><li><a href=http://hacdan.org/post/pixel_conclusion/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Conclution</a></li></ul></div></article><hr><div class=post-info><p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-tag meta-icon"><path d="M20.59 13.41l-7.17 7.17a2 2 0 01-2.83.0L2 12V2h10l8.59 8.59a2 2 0 010 2.82z"/><line x1="7" y1="7" x2="7" y2="7"/></svg><span class=tag><a href=https://hacdan.org/tags/untagged/>untagged</a></span></p><p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-file-text"><path d="M14 2H6A2 2 0 004 4v16a2 2 0 002 2h12a2 2 0 002-2V8z"/><polyline points="14 2 14 8 20 8"/><line x1="16" y1="13" x2="8" y2="13"/><line x1="16" y1="17" x2="8" y2="17"/><polyline points="10 9 9 9 8 9"/></svg>467 Words</p><p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-calendar"><rect x="3" y="4" width="18" height="18" rx="2" ry="2"/><line x1="16" y1="2" x2="16" y2="6"/><line x1="8" y1="2" x2="8" y2="6"/><line x1="3" y1="10" x2="21" y2="10"/></svg>2016-07-18 20:00</p></div><div class=pagination><div class=pagination__title><span class=pagination__title-h></span><hr></div><div class=pagination__buttons><span class="button previous"><a href=https://hacdan.org/posts/pixels_everywhere_review/><span class=button__icon>←</span>
