<p>July 15th. That’s the day my coupon code for a Google Pixel C expired. Counting down the days to when the dream of moving to said tablet would be shattered. Shattered on principal anyway. There was no way I could justify paying full price for the Pixel C. It’s great hardware, sure, but it’s not $500 worth of hardware.</p>
<p>Driving home from work on Tuesday my phone went off. A text message, probably another scammer. I checked the area code and noticed it was local. It was someone inquiring about my computer post on Craigslist. I was shocked to say the least. There hadn’t been any bites on my machine for a few months now and I had honestly given up hope. I answered the few questions that the buyer had and we worked out a price. Sure, it was less than what I was hoping for, but it would be enough. Enough to fulfill the dream of decoupling from distraction.</p>
<p>The buyer really wanted to meet that night, but I wasn’t home! We finally agreed to meet the next night at my house so he could check out the machine. The next night came and I honestly paced for a good hour in the office, wondering if this guy was going to come to pick it up. Time was running out and if this buyer didn’t work out, well I was going to pull the machine and work on my self-control.</p>
<p>So anyway, the buyer texted me letting me know he would be in there in about 30 minutes. Does this mean things were finally going to work out? I had a glimmer of hope that things would work out..</p>
<h2 id="it-happened-it-finally-happened">It happened, it finally happened!</h2>
<p>So, he showed, we talked, I made a new friend, and we even have a mutual friend! Things could not have worked out better, well I guess sooner would have been nice, but, patience really is a virtue! We were both satisfied with the deal and things worked out. I’m light one Haswell powered beast of a machine and that is a feeling I’m perfectly fine with.</p>
<h2 id="where-to-from-here">Where to from here?</h2>
<p>So where do we go from here? Well, as mentioned in a previous post, I had planned on moving to a tablet and keyboard setup, and that is exactly what I did. The night the machine sold I promptly hopped on the Google Store page and ordered up a Pixel C and Keyboard. Those should be arriving today(19th). I can’t wait to get home and unbox them and start using them. Over the next couple of posts I’ll have a hardware and software review of the device, so look for that starting this Friday!</p>
<p>Stay tuned!</p>
