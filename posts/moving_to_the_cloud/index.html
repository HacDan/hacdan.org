        <h2 id="the-cloud">The Cloud</h2>
<h2 id="my-story">My Story</h2>
<p>An adventure. That’s the best way that I can describe this process. My development work, at least in this part of my life, has always been a side project, but I’d taken it somewhat seriously. I found myself, though, wandering off to do other things instead of concentrating on my true passion. <em>Writing software</em>. I hadn’t really thought about solving the concentration problem because, who cares right? It’s just a hobby, no need to get serious about it. I do have a degree in software engineering, but I’m not using it in my current position, so why bother?</p>
<p>The <em>why bother?</em> question is what really got me thinking though. That’s not the self that I knew. That is someone totally different. I have never been the one to just settle. Be happy with what I know and move on. I have to keep learning, it’s in fact always been one of my life goals. I don’t want to stop learning. So, I started thinking of ways to solve the concentration problem.</p>
<h3 id="phase-one">Phase One</h3>
<p>Phase one of solving the problem was a complete and utter failure, but that’s okay. An attempt was made. I decided to remove distractions with pure and utter will power. Now, for someone with an addictive personality, I find, at least for myself, that just will power is not enough to force a change in my life. It has to be something drastic, unsettling, but, I tried anyway. Eventually I slipped back into wandering off to different things, gaming, media consumption, Internet wars, etc.. This was when I realized that I needed to do things a bit differently.</p>
<h3 id="phase-two">Phase Two</h3>
<p>Phase two was when I started thinking of different ways to remove the temptation of distractions from my <strong>workflow</strong> if one could even call it that. I started looking into a laptop computer. Something if you’d asked me a couple years ago if I’d ever go back to, I would have called you crazy. I loved my desktop, and had built it with my own two hands to do exactly what I wanted it to do, but, alas, I needed to make a change. So, for a few months I researched into many different options. I eventually had made my mind up and decided to go back to a Mac. I started moving my workflow over to an OS X VM to see if I could quickly adapt to the OS again. I had no trouble and was quickly back into the groove. The problem was, the groove was still the distractions and unfocused groove that I was trying to avoid. I didn’t end up purchasing a Mac, although, let me tell you, I was close. Very close. And I’m so happy that I didn’t.</p>
<h3 id="phase-three">Phase Three</h3>
<p>Enter Google Compute Engine(aka <em>THE CLOUD</em>). This is where I am now. I write this post in Markdown inside of VIM, and quite frankly I’m loving it. The distraction has gone away as I sit here, SSH’d into a GCE instance with very limited resources, but it’s just enough to run all of my development tools. I did, however, have to make a change to my development style. A drastic one at that. Most of the tools I used on a daily basis already ran just fine on Linux as that is where I was doing my development before. What they didn’t do, though, is run without a graphical user interface. They were (mostly) capable of doing so, but it was not something that I was used to. So, onto learning I did, and I still am. I have written a few Python scripts that wrap up some of the build tools that I was used to just clicking a button for, but that’s okay. I’m learning, and that’s been my whole goal.</p>
<h3 id="where-to-from-here">Where to from here?</h3>
<p>Well, Phase Three does address part of the concern about reducing distractions, but I want to take it a few steps further. I’m in the process of selling my beloved desktop computer that I built, and moving onto something a bit less powerful, but free of many of the distractions that I had before.</p>
<p><img src="/img/pixelc.png" alt="Pixel C">
That will be a tablet with attached keyboard. Now, this is a huge jump from the three monitors I’m sitting in front of at the moment and multiple cores of x86 power backing them, but I think it’s the right move for me. A move I should have made a long time ago in my life. A move that I hope will bring about more learning and fewer distractions. I’m looking into a couple of tablets at the moment, but I’m mainly focusing on the <a href="https://pixel.google.com/pixel-c">Pixel C</a> by Google along with it’s available keyboard accessory. My only worry is that when I want to take it mobile, the keyboard is lacking some keys that I would normally use on I’d say a semi-regular basis.</p>
<p>I don’t know if that will be the tablet that I end up going with, but I do know, that if I want to keep learning and remove distractions from my workflow I have to change something. This desktop will not do. I hope to, a few months from now, come back and revisit this topic. As it’s something I’ve become very passionate about. I do not think this is for every, or for every developers style. What I do believe, however, is that if you’re having trouble with distractions, this would be a great direction to at least experiment with.</p>
<p>I have a few more posts in the works that have more detail about what tools I’m using, how I’m using them, and what I’m working on developing to help improve my workflow.</p>
<h2 id="inspirations">Inspirations</h2>
<p>I thought I should mention what inspired me to make the move to a cloud based development approach, along with ideas on what to change my hardware out for. Links below.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://yieldthought.com/post.12239282034/swawpped-my-macbook-for-an-ipad">Yield Thought: I swapped my MacBook for an iPad + Linode</a></li>
<li><a href="http://bergie.iki.fi/blog/working-on-android/">Henri Berigus: Working on an Android Tablet</a></li>
</ul>
<p>There are more, but I seem to have lost the links to them. Irregardless, these posts might be a few years old, but things have only gotten better, not worse. Tablets have improved, cloud computing instances have gotten cheaper, it’s just all around better. I will say that taking this route, you will most likely need to write a bit of custom toolery to get started, as not much exists for development based around the CLI anymore, at least not for the typical Joe Computer Programmer.</p>
