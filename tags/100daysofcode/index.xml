As with most people I like the idea of starting new projects, but the newness tends to ween after a little while and well&amp;hellip; the project gets boring. While I&amp;rsquo;m not there yet with any of my current projects, I know I will get there sooner rather than later. Because of this, I&amp;rsquo;m deciding to commit to #100daysofcode .
I don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;ll blog about every day that I complete of this challenge, but I do plan on posting updates from time-to-time regarding this challenge.</description></item></channel></rss>
