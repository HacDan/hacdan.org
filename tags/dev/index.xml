      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hear me out. I know, cheesy title to say the least, but it&amp;rsquo;s what came to mind when I decided I wanted to write about this quandry of mine.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;frontend-backend-or-side-to-side&#34;&gt;Front(end) Back(end), or Side to Side?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That quandry is this (if you haven&amp;rsquo;t figured it out from the title by now):  What stack to work with? Honestly? I don&amp;rsquo;t know. I really enjoy backend development where I&amp;rsquo;m working on API&amp;rsquo;s, database integrations, and the like. I really do. I find it to be an interesting set of problems to solve, but I often wonder if I pidgeonholed myself into thinking that I had to be a backend developer because I&amp;rsquo;m not an artist or designer. Of course all the devs I know are back end developers, but does that mean I have to be one? Of course it doesn&amp;rsquo;t, but I&amp;rsquo;m sure it does mean something. I mean, I really like solving logic puzzles as opposed to converting designs into usable code, but at the same time, I sure do like seeing a project through from start to finish.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
