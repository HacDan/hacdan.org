      <description>I have a problem with staying motivated. As with most people I like the idea of starting new projects, but the newness tends to ween after a little while and well&amp;hellip; the project gets boring. While I&amp;rsquo;m not there yet with any of my current projects, I know I will get there sooner rather than later. Because of this, I&amp;rsquo;m deciding to commit to #100daysofcode .
I don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;ll blog about every day that I complete of this challenge, but I do plan on posting updates from time-to-time regarding this challenge.</description>

      <description>Hear me out. I know, cheesy title to say the least, but it&amp;rsquo;s what came to mind when I decided I wanted to write about this quandry of mine.
Front(end) Back(end), or Side to Side? That quandry is this (if you haven&amp;rsquo;t figured it out from the title by now): What stack to work with? Honestly? I don&amp;rsquo;t know. I really enjoy backend development where I&amp;rsquo;m working on API&amp;rsquo;s, database integrations, and the like.</description>
